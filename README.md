## Tips

* As you make changes to this project, be mindful of the requirements
* It's a good practice to check the changes in your project before adding them to the staging area. You want to make sure you are only tracking the files you intend to.

## Notes:
1. If you realize your PR includes files that are not supposed to be tracked, you can delete your local and remote repository and start over.
